# Everything You Need to Know About Minecraft

Here is a simple guide to how to play the game for anyone new! This site will pretty much touch everything general about the game; for more in depth research please visit mojang.com.

Minecraft was created in May of 2009 by Mojang Studios. This game has resurfaced many times over the past years and is now being popularized by many gaming sites such as Twitch. Because of its traction to different audiences, it is important to understand what the game is about and how to play it.

## Objectives of the Game

Minecraft is the kind of game where there are no limitations to what a player could possibly do. It was designed for the gamer to be like a creator, where they can either choose to explore and compete to beat the game or instead build and design to make a home. In other words, you as the player have the power to make the game your own. 

A few of the objectives are pretty general because they are only the main things you can do when playing. Keep in mind that the possibilities are endless for this game. 

There are three types of game modes: Creative, Survival, and Adventure. Creative gives you an unlimited amount of resources and blocks. This mode is mainly used for building since you as the player have the ability to do practically anything in the game. Survival, on the other hand, has made the player start off at spawn with no food, supplies, nor shelter. Instead, you are put in a terrain where you are made to survive and eventually beat the game. Adventure mode is a mix of the two; it is mainly used for testing and not really considered one of the main gamemodes of Minecraft.

The player gathers resources mainly using tools, which can be crafted after mining wood or stone or any other ore. The very first thing a player should do is chop down a tree for sticks and blocks. Wooden tools will give you access to mining stone, which will give you access to many other opportunities.

It's also important to pay attention to your health and hunger, which is located above the hotbar on your screen. Once your health reaches 0 hearts, you are forced to respawn (unless you play in hardcore, in which your game is no longer accessible the first time you die). Your hunger will deplete the more you exercise your character, but it can be refilled by eating food that is either dropped from animals or farmed. Regenerating your hunger will also regenerate your health, which is why it is important not to starve your player.

## Biomes

There are different terrains that you may encounter while playing. 
- Plains
- Jungle
- Forest
- Savannah 
- Mountains
- Desert
- Taiga
- Tundra
- Swamp
- Badlands
- Ocean
- Mushroom
- The Nether
- The End

The Nether and the End are two biomes that a player will need to encounter (as well as the biome they spawn in) when completing the game. The Nether drops necessary resources for the player to get to the End, where the Enderdragon (the final boss) lives.

## Types of Mobs

Mobs usually spawn according to their biome and they can also be equipped with certain tools that can help inflict damage.
- Zombie
- Creeper
- Skeleton
- Spider
- Enderman
- Vindicator
- Pillager
- Ravager
- Vex
- Guardian
- Ghast
- Blaze
- Slime
- Magma Cube
- Hoglin
- Witch
- Drowned
- etc. 

These mobs differ in health and hostility and mostly appear during the nighttime. They will stay away from any bright or lit up areas.

## How to Craft

Creating a crafting table is done by having one wood log, converting that into four wooden planks, and then constructing that into a crafting table using the inventory slot. This table, when clicked on, consists of nine different slots that can craft any recipe already known in the game. A few of these recipes are fairly simple and can be easily accessed using the handbook for new players. However, the more you play the game, the more recognizable these recipes become and therefore the less you will need to use the handbook.
